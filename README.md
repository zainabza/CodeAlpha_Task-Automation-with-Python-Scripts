# CodeAlpha_Task-Automation-with-Python-Scripts
Purpose:
As a student, managing and organizing files can get messy. This script helps automatically sort files into folders based on their type (e.g., images, documents, videos).

Features:
Sorts files into categories like Images, Documents, Videos, Music, Archives, and Others.
Automatically creates folders for each category if they donâ€™t exist.
Handles case sensitivity and moves unclassified files to an "Others" folder.
How to Use:
Run the script.
Enter the folder path you want to organize.
Let the script do the sorting for you!
Example:
Before: A cluttered folder with mixed file types.
After: Files neatly organized into category-based folders!
